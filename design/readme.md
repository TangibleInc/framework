# Design library

This is a set of design styles, components, and assets and for use by Tangible plugins.

## Plan

Integrate the general-purpose design library with curated tokens and CSS variables.

- `core.min.css`
  - class `t-design`
- `core.min.js`
  - `Tangible.Design`
- `component.*.min.css`
  - class `t-Component`
- `component.*.min.js`
  - class `Component` exported from `@tangible/design`
